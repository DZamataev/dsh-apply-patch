/**
 * Git and unified diff parser.
 *
 * A hunk body is read by its header counts: while the hunk still expects old
 * or new lines, every ` `, `-` or `+` line is payload, also one that looks like
 * a `---`/`+++` file header, and a blank line is an empty context line.
 * `\ No newline at end of file` may follow any hunk line and removes the LF of
 * that line only, as in git. A CR before the LF belongs to the line, as in git.
 * File headers are recognized only between hunks. Git header lines (`index`,
 * modes, `new file mode`, `deleted file mode`, renames, `---`/`+++`) are read
 * only right after a `diff --git` line, up to the first line that is not one,
 * as `apply.c` `parse_git_diff_header` reads them; anywhere else (after a hunk,
 * before a bare `---`/`+++` pair) they are text git skips. A `diff --git` line
 * without header lines is such text too. A `diff --git` section without a hunk
 * right after its header lines must be a new file, a deletion, a rename or a
 * mode change. Between a bare `+++` header and the first hunk nothing may
 * stand. The parser is lenient where models are sloppy, but never so that lines
 * are silently dropped:
 *
 * - text before the first header and between files (prose, a ```diff fence, `Index:` lines) is skipped;
 * - a hunk may end before its counts are reached at the end of the text, at the next hunk header or at `diff --git`; its trailing unprefixed blank lines are then separators. Such a hunk is rejected when its body contains a `---`/`+++` pair, which may have been the next file's header;
 * - an unprefixed line inside a counted hunk, and a `-` or `+` line right after a hunk whose counts are reached, are rejected with their line number;
 * - a line starting with `\` is a newline marker only as git reads one ({@link isMarker}); inside a hunk any other such line is rejected, after a hunk it is skipped like other text there;
 * - `@@ @@` and `@@` without line numbers are accepted; such a hunk ends at the first line that is not ` `, `-`, `+` or `\`, or at a `---`/`+++` pair;
 * - the last line of the text may lack its LF (git rejects such a diff as corrupt);
 * - a path ends at a TAB (git writes one after a path ending in a space; `diff -u` puts a timestamp after it) or at the end of the line; spaces around it are part of the path. Quoted C-style paths are decoded. A CR at the end of a header line is dropped.
 *
 * In a `diff --git` section the file moves when its old and new names differ
 * (`rename from`/`rename to`, or differing `---`/`+++` names), as with git;
 * `---`/`+++ /dev/null` there needs the `new file mode`/`deleted file mode`
 * line. Two differing names of a bare `---`/`+++` pair (`foo.c.orig` and
 * `foo.c`) patch the `+++` file.
